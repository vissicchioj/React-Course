            <p>
                Outside of the world of computer science, I have a love for video games, movies, and working out. 
                Some of my favorite video games include Elden Ring, Inscryption, and Fire Emblem. Some of my favorite movies include The Shining, Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse, and really dumb Adam Sandler films. 
                I used to do Crossfit but now I mostly stick to cardio or basic lifts such as deadlifts, squats, and benching.
